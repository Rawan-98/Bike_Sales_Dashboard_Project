# Bike Sales Dashboard Project

## Description
This project analyzes bike sales data to uncover trends and insights about customer purchasing behavior. Using Excel, I created a dashboard to visualize key demographics such as income, age, and region, helping businesses understand their target audience better.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for data analysis, Pivot Tables, and creating dashboards)

## Project Contents
- *Bike_Sale_Dashboard.pdf*: A PDF file showcasing the final dashboard with visualizations and insights derived from the data.
- *Bike_Sale_Raw_Dataset.xlsx*: The raw dataset containing customer information such as income, age, region, and whether they purchased a bike.

## Key Insights
- Customers with higher incomes (above $80,000) are more likely to purchase bikes.
- Younger customers (ages 25-35) in the Pacific region show a higher purchase rate.
- Commute distance impacts purchasing decisions, with shorter distances (0-1 miles) linked to more bike purchases.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset (Bike_Sale_Raw_Dataset.xlsx) to explore the raw data.
2. Open the dashboard (Bike_Sale_Dashboard.pdf) to view the visualizations and insights.

## Additional Notes
- The data was cleaned and processed in Excel to remove duplicates and inconsistencies.
- Pivot Tables were used to summarize purchasing trends by region and demographic.
